Happy National Girlfriend Day. I'm sorry that I'm giving this to you late. I love you so much. I'm not good at expressing myself in words but I really hope you know how much you mean to me. It physically hurts when I can't see you cuz I actually miss you sooo much. You are the best thing that's ever happened to me. I can't imagine what I would do without you. I can never stop thinking about you. You're on my mind 24/7. No matter what I'm doing I'm always thinking about you. Also you are soooo smart even though you don't think so sometimes and you are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. You are always sooo cute and also very hawt. I think sometimes you think too low of yourself and I don't like that because you are sooo amazing. Everything about you is perfect and I want to make sure you know that. I also hope you know that you could never annoy me and I want you to text me all the time and call me whenever and just tell me anything and everything even if you don't think I'll care cuz I always do. Also never be afraid to tell me how you are feeling, I always want to hear how you are and I don't want you to ever pretend to be okay when you aren't. I want you to spam me even if I'm busy cuz I'm always thinking about you regardless and I promise I wouldn't mind. You are the best girlfriend to exist. I love you baby.
