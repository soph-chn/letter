Happy National Girlfriend Day. I'm sorry that I'm giving this to you late. I love you so much. I'm not good at expressing myself in words but I really hope you know how much you mean to me. It physically hurts when I can't see you cuz I actually miss you sooo much.

You are the best thing that's ever happened to me. I can't imagine what I would do without you. I can never stop thinking about you. You're on my mind 24/7. No matter what I'm doing I'm always thinking about you.
